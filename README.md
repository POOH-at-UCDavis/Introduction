### <span style="color:darkblue">What We Do</span>
The purpose of POOH is to facilitate bioinformatic learning and discussions. We want to build a community which serves as a helpfull resource for people doing computational biology. We cover topics ranging from basic coding to the nuances of bioinformatic tools. Join our community for  discovery, implementation, and project feedback in bioinformatics.

### <span style="color:darkblue">Who Can Join</span>
We welcome all levels of users in all related topics. As the name implies, we are mostly focused on the analysis of various types of biological 'omics data, but other datasets are welcome! 

We meet weekly for 1-2 hours to share our projects and  help each other solve whatever problems we are facing.
